CairoSVG 2.5.1 has been released!

**WARNING:** this is a security update.

When processing SVG files, CairoSVG was using two regular expressions which are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDoS).

If an attacker provided a malicious SVG, it could make CairoSVG get stuck processing the file for a very long time.

Other bug fixes:

* Fix marker positions for unclosed paths
* Follow hint when only output_width or output_height is set
* Handle opacity on raster images
* Donâ€™t crash when use tags reference unknown tags
* Take care of the next letter when A/a is replaced by l
* Fix misalignment in node.vertices
